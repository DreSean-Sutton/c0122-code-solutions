User can sign up:
The user interacts with the client and inputs a unique username with a password. They are sent to the server and if they're viable,
the password is hashed by argon2. Then, the username and hashed password is queried as a `select` request to be added to the database.
The database sends a response back to the server, which then informs the client whether the username and password were
successfully updated to the database or not.

User can sign in:
The user interacts with the client and inputs a unique username with a password. If they're viable, they are sent to the server.
In the server, it queries a `select` request to the database and grabs the userId and hashedPassword using the client's username if it is in there.
The server then verifies whether or not the hashedPassword is equal to the client's password. If it's matching,
the user is given a special token with the userId, their username, and the TOKEN_SECRET.

User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page):
When a user signs in, their token is automatically put into their local storage. Any hash changes or refreshing of the page,
grabs their token from local storage, decodes it, and uses it's information to change the state of the app back to that specific user.

User can sign out:
When the user signs out, their token is removed from their local storage. User state is also changed to null,
effectively changing the page back to the homepage.
